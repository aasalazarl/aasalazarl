Hello! My name is Alejandro. I am a Data Analyst specializing in data visualization, data cleaning, simulations and computer modeling, and manipulation of data for a variety of applications.

My work encompasses:
* Error analysis
* Database creation (SQL)
* Forecasting
* Mathematical modeling
* Simulations of dynamic phenomena

I have successfully applied these skills across several fields, including **Science**, **Finance**, **Marketing**, **Machine Learning**, **Artificial Intelligence**, **Physics**, and **Mathematics**.

üìö **PROJECTS**

Notable projects:
- Created machine learning software development for analyzing large datasets for the MoEDAL-MAPP Collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider.
- Conducted A/B testing for marketing strategies.
- Tested AI applications for Google Assistant and Android applications (through DataAnnotation).
- Explored digital holography and tomography with programming.
- Designed Honors Science Data Analysis for Experimental Physics course at the University of Alberta.
- Processed seismic signals for event localization at Nanometrics Inc.
- Studentship focused on overstock analysis and marketing mix strategies.

My work involves translating sophisticated scientific tools and models for adaptation to dynamic market processes through programming.
